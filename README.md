Code for compiling and analyzing data for the paper 'Discharge regimes of  North American high-latitude rivers' by Karen L. Jorgenson and Tamara K. Harms. 


Abstract:

Regimes of river discharge, characterized by the timing and magnitude of seasonal and stochastic flow variation, are changing in northern rivers due to warming climate. Heterogeneity in long-term trends of discharge across high-latitude basins has made it difficult to anticipate how river flows might change under accelerated climate warming. We characterized seasonal and stochastic variation in long-term records of mean daily discharge from 172 rivers in Alaska and northern Canada over 2000-2022. Floods were of shorter duration and occurred later in the year in Marine West Coast Forest compared to other ecoregions. Strongest seasonal relative to stochastic variation in flows occurred in the Northwest Forested Mountains ecoregion, likely driven by a consistent snowmelt pulse in spring. Discharge in glacial catchments was more strongly seasonal than in non-glacial catchments, likely due to production of meltwater in summer. Flow regimes of catchments receiving more rain were characterized by weaker seasonal variation and high-flow anomalies that occurred earlier in the year. In contrast, greater snowfall resulted in strongly seasonal regimes with anomalous high flows later in the year. We also contrasted discharge regimes of 72 rivers between ~1970-1992 and 2000-2022, finding less seasonal relative to stochastic variation in recent decades and anomalous high flows occurring later in the year. Discharge from glacial rivers was relatively resistant to change, suggesting buffering by seasonal glacial melt. Shrinking of the cryosphere and shifts in the precipitation regime under continued warming will increase stochasticity and decrease seasonality in the flows of high-latitude rivers.


Notes:

R scripts 1-2 download and filter river discharge data from the U.S. Geological Survey and the Water Survey of Canada. 

R scripts 4-6 download reanalysis climate data (ERA5) from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. Dowloading and processing the ERA5 data takes multiple days. The processed monthly climate data is available in 'Output_data/All_ERA5_monthly_AK_CAN.csv'.
